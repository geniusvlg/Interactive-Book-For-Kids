                "had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as\n" +
                "far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued,\n" +
                "in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared\n" +
                "to be in perfect health — apart from the fact that they were all\n" +

                "Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with\n" +
                "either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones\n" +
                "through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles\n" +
                "over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or\n" +
                "twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old\n" +
                "Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an\n" +
                "obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden,\n" +
                "brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for\n" +
                "his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their\n" +
                "parents and grandparents, thought him a murderer. So when Frank\n" +
                "awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the\n" +
                "old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further\n" +
                "in their attempts to punish him.\n" +
                "It was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse\n" +
                "than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the\n" +
                "kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the\n" +
                "stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he\n" +
                "looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its\n" +
                "upper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys\n" +
                "had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering\n" +
                "quality of the light, they had started a fire.\n" +
                "Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had deeply mistrusted\n" +
                "the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning\n" +
                "about the Riddles’ deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried ",
        "back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back\n" +
                "in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from\n" +
                "its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was\n" +
                "propped against the wall, and set off into the night.\n" +
                "The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being\n" +
                "forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the\n" +
                "back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden\n" +
                "by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened\n" +
                "the door noiselessly.\n" +
                "He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered\n" +
                "it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he\n" +
                "remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his\n" +
                "way toward it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for\n" +
                "any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the\n" +
                "hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows\n" +
                "on either side of the front door, and started to climb the\n" +
                "stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it\n" +
                "muffled the sound of his feet and stick.\n" +
                "On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the\n" +
                "intruders were: At the very end of the passage a door stood ajar,\n" +
                "and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of\n" +
                "gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, grasping\n" +
                "his walking stick firmly. Several feet from the entrance, he was able\n" +
                "to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.\n" +
                "The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised\n" +
                "him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man’s\n" +
                "voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.\n" +
                "“There is a little more in the bottle, my Lord, if you are still\n" +
                "hungry.”",
        "“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a man — but\n" +
                "it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy\n" +
                "wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on\n" +
                "the back of Frank’s neck stand up. “Move me closer to the fire,\n" +
                "Wormtail.”\n" +
                "Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear.\n" +
                "There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard\n" +
                "surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being\n" +
                "dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man,\n" +
                "his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a\n" +
                "long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head.\n" +
                "Then he went out of sight again.\n" +
                "“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.\n" +
                "“I — I don’t know, my Lord,” said the first voice nervously. “She\n" +
                "set out to explore the house, I think. . . .”\n" +
                "“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said the second\n" +
                "voice. “I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me\n" +
                "greatly.”\n" +
                "Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the\n" +
                "door, listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man\n" +
                "called Wormtail spoke again.\n" +
                "“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?”\n" +
                "“A week,” said the cold voice. “Perhaps longer. The place is moderately\n" +
                "comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be\n" +
                "foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.”\n" +
                "Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing,\n" +
                "no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word\n" +
                "“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.\n" +
                "“The — the Quidditch World Cup, my Lord?” said Wormtail",
        "(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.) “Forgive\n" +
                "me, but — I do not understand — why should we wait until the\n" +
                "World Cup is over?”\n" +
                "“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the\n" +

                "of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual\n" +
                "activity, checking and double-checking identities. They will be\n" +
                "obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we\n" +
                "wait.”\n" +
                "Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard\n" +
                "the words “Ministry of Magic,” “wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly,\n" +
                "each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could\n" +
                "think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies\n" +
                "and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once\n" +
                "more, and listened more closely still.\n" +
                "“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.\n" +
                "“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of\n" +
                "menace in the cold voice now.\n" +
                "A slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke, the words\n" +
                "tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to\n" +
                "say this before he lost his nerve.\n" +
                "“It could be done without Harry Potter, my Lord.”\n" +
                "Another pause, more protracted, and then —\n" +
                "“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice softly. “I\n" +
                "see . . .”\n" +
                "“My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!” said\n" +
                "Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. “The boy is nothing to me,\n" +
                "nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or ",

                "quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while — you\n" +

                "“My Lord, it makes sense,” said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly\n" +

                "you, Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be\n" +

                "“Liar,” breathed the second voice. “I am no stronger, and a few\n" +
                "days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have\n" +

                "“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never see me\n" +

                "on our end, something that’s likely to affect the Muggles — the\n" +
                "non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, it’s live and let\n" +
                "live. And I must say, you’re taking it a lot better than your predecessor.\n" +
                "He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax\n" +

                "“You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?”\n" +
                "It had been his last, desperate hope.\n" +
                "“No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.”\n" +
                "And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a gerbil.\n" +
                "“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup\n" +
                "chewing on the corner of his next speech, “but why — why has nobody\n" +

        "The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had\n" +
                "tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination\n" +
                "brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign.\n" +
                "In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this\n" +
                "uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted\n" +
                "niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait\n" +

                "used to transfer the boy –“\n" +
                " Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching\n" +
                "resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.\n" +
                " “Where are they going to hide the boy next?”\n" +

                " Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.\n" +
                " “My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have – with difficulty, and after great\n" +
                "effort – succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.”\n" +
                " Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a\n" +

                "easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the\n" +

                " “As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the\n" +
                "rest,” said Voldemort. “At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine\n" +
                "before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done\n" +
                "while he travels.”\n" +
                " “We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed determined to\n" +

                " Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, “I shall\n" +
                "attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is\n" +
                "concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors\n" +
                "than to his triumphs.”\n" +
                " The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them,\n" +
                "by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter’s continued\n" +
                "existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of\n" +
                "them, still addressing the unconscious body above him. ",
        "“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those\n" +
                "wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things\n" +
                "that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”\n" +
                " At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible,\n" +
                "drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled,\n" +
                "for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet.\n" +
                " “Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and\n" +
                "without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, “have I not spoken to you\n" +
                "about keeping our prisoner quiet?”\n" +
                " “Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been\n" +
                "sitting so low in his chair that it appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he\n" +
                "scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a\n" +
                "curious gleam of silver.\n" +
                " “As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his\n" +
                "followers, “I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one\n" +
                "of you before I go to kill Potter.”\n" +
                " The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that\n" +
                "he wanted to borrow one of their arms.\n" +
                " “No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see … Lucius, I see no reason for you to\n" +
                "have a wand anymore.”\n" +
                " Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight,\n" +
                "and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse.\n" +
                " “My Lord?”\n" +
                " “Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.”\n" +
                " “I …”\n" +
                " Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale\n" +
                "as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim\n" +
                "fingers closed briefly on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes,\n" +
                "withdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red\n" +
                "eyes, examining it closely.\n" +
                " “What is it?”\n" +
                " “Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy.\n" +
                " “And the core?”\n" +
                " “Dragon – dragon heartstring.”\n" +
                " “Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his wand and compared the lengths. Lucius\n" +
                "Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected\n" +
                "to receive Voldemort’s wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by\n" +
                "Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously.\n" +
                " “Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?”\n" +
                " Some of the throng sniggered.\n" +
                " “I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have\n" +
                "noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late … What is it about my\n" +
                "presence in your home that displaces you, Lucius?”\n" +
                " “Nothing – nothing, my Lord!”\n" +
                " “Such lies Lucius … “ ",
        "The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving.\n" +
                "One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder;\n" +
                "something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table.\n" +
                " The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose, seemingly\n" +
                "endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a\n" +
                "man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked\n" +
                "the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.\n" +
                " “Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my rise to\n" +
                "power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”\n" +
                " “Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat\n" +
                "from his upper lip. “We did desire it – we do.”\n" +
                " To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from\n" +
                "Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the\n" +
                "inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye\n" +
                "contact.\n" +
                " “My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with\n" +
                "emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s house. There can be no higher\n" +
                "pleasure.”\n" +
                " She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily\n" +
                "lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive,\n" +
                "Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for\n" +
                "closeness.\n" +
                " “No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he\n" +
                "considered Bellatrix. “That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.”\n" +
                " Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight.\n" +
                " “My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!”\n" +
                " “No higher pleasure … even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has\n" +
                "taken place in your family this week?”\n" +
                " She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.\n" +
                " “I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.”\n" +
                " “I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She has\n" +
                "just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.”\n" +
                " There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned\n" +
                "forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The giant\n" +
                "snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death\n" +
                "Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys’ humiliation.\n" +
                "Bellatrix’s face, so recently flushed wit happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red.\n" +
                " “She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring of mirth. “We –\n" +
                "Narcissa and I – have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This\n" +
                "brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.”\n" +
                " “What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it\n" +
                "carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will you babysit the cubs?”\n" +
                " The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was\n" +
                "staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother’s eye. She shook her head almost\n" +
                "imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall.\n" +
                " “Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. “Enough.” ",
        "And the laughter died at once.\n" +
                " “Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,” he said as\n" +
                "Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring, “You must prune yours, must you not,\n" +
                "to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.”\n" +
                " “Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude\n" +
                "again. “At the first chance!”\n" +
                " “You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so in the world … we\n" +
                "shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain …”\n" +
                " Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly\n" +
                "revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to life\n" +
                "with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds.\n" +
                " “Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort.\n" +
                " Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death Eaters were\n" +
                "looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permission to show\n" +
                "curiosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified\n" +
                "voice, “Severus! Help me!”\n" +
                " “Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.\n" +
                " “And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout with his wandfree\n" +
                "hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed\n" +
                "unable to look at her anymore.\n" +
                " “But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort. “For those of you\n" +
                "who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently,\n" +
                "taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”\n" +
                " There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched\n" +
                "woman with pointed teeth cackled.\n" +
                " “Yes … Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about\n" +
                "Muggles … how they are not so different from us … “\n" +
                " One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape\n" +
                "again.\n" +
                " “Severus … please … please … “\n" +
                " “Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s wand, and Charity fell\n" +
                "silent as if gagged. “Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding\n" +
                "children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the\n" +
                "Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and\n" +
                "magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable\n" +
                "circumstance … She would have us all mate with Muggles … or, no doubt, werewolves\n" +
                "… “\n" +
                " Nobody laughed this time. There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in\n" +
                "Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears\n" +
                "were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as\n" +
                "she turned slowly away from him again.\n" +
                " “Avada Kedavra”\n" +
                " The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a\n" +
                "resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death\n" +
                "Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor. ",
        "“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered\n" +
                "from his shoulders onto the polished wood.\n" +
                "Chapter Two\n" +
                "In Memorandum\n" +
                "Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his\n" +
                "breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china. He\n" +
                "had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom\n" +
                "door.\n" +
                " \"What the --?\"\n" +
                " He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted.\n" +
                "Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his bleeding\n" +
                "hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw\n" +
                "them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped\n" +
                "across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap.\n" +
                " It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of\n" +
                "being unable to perform magic…but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his\n" +
                "finger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he\n" +
                "came to think of it – particularly in light of his immediate plans – this seemed a serious\n" +
                "flaw in his magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done,\n" +
                "he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before\n" +
                "returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.\n" +
                " Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first\n" +
                "time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he\n" +
                "had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or\n" +
                "updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom – old quills, desiccated\n" +
                "beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his\n" +
                "hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand,\n" +
                "and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood.\n" +
                " He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again,\n" +
                "he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly\n" +
                "between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out\n" +
                "Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he\n" +
                "finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It\n" +
                "was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had\n" +
                "given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing ",
        "more remained of his godfather's last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the\n" +
                "deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.\n" +
                " Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing\n" +
                "nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment\n" +
                "on top of that morning's Daily prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to\n" +
                "stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the\n" +

                "were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do\n" +
                "with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were evidence of some\n" +
                "dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books,\n" +

                "been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder's Map and the\n" +
                "locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor\n" +
                "not because it was valuable – in all usual senses it was worthless – but because of what it\n" +

                "I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our\n" +
                "mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be\n" +
                "outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while ",
        "I was no longer contagious, my pock-marked visage and greenish hue did not\n" +
                "encourage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts\n" +
                "under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father,\n" +
                "Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three\n" +
                "young Muggles.\n" +
                "Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had\n" +
                "committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he\n" +
